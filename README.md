# Curses Examples

These are some scripts showing different examples of using curses. This is written on a Windows 10 system with Python 3.8.2 installed via the Microsoft store.

All examples come from the blog post [Curses Programming in Python](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/curses-programming-python).
